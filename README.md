# CNN-Project

This is my Python project in which I designed a software to identify Sickled-Blood cell images in blood smear pictures provided by the user. In here I used Convolutional Neural Network to do my work. I used tenorflow and keras python libraries to create a CNN and designed this project's UI in python only.
